The Agile Deployment Toolkit supports the following application database:

Joomla 4 using MySQL, MariaDB or Postgresql is supported
Wordpress using MySQL or MariaDB is supported
Drupal using MySQL, MariaDB or Postgres is supported

If you wish to extend the toolkit so that, for example, Moodle is supported using Postgresql, you are more than welcome.
