To be more secure, when you are using cloudflare you might want to firewall off the 443 and 80 ports to only be accessible by cloudflare ip addresses.  
This is done automatically if you deploy an autoscaler, but, in development mode, there are no autoscalers to manage the firewall, so, when you are in development mode you need to do the firewalling manually, in other words, you need to add these ip addresses: [Cloudflare IP Addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/) to your native firewalling system. Even if you don't, the UFW system will, but, the native firewalling systems are reckoned to be beefier than UFW.
