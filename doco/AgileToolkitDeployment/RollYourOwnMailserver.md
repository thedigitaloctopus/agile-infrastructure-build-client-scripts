There are a few solutions to providing email services for your users:

1. Allow any domain email addresses in your application, like gmail, yahoo and so on.
2. If you want your users to have their own custom domain, you can do something like this: [Mail Forwarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEheS8gM4Xs)
3. If you want to run your own email server, you can run one using [iRedmail](https://www.iredmail.org) or [Mail in a box](https://mailinabox.email) or [Modoba](https://modoboa.org/en/)

Of course, if you want to use this solution for your pre-existing organisation and your peeps already have custom email address, you can use the mail solution you already use or have.
