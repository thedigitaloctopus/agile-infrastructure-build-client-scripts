The vision for this toolkit is to have 5 different classes of user role.

1. **Toolkit developers/extenders** - these are people who either maintain or update the core of the ADT or fork their own version to extend for their particular needs.
2. **Toolkit deployers** - these are people who deploy websites using the toolkit but don't actively extend the toolkit. Typically the will deploy applications built by appication developers (next).
3. **Application developers** - these are people who develop applications through the toolkit such as Joomla appllications or Wordpress applications and then provide a baseline of their customised application to 3rd party customers
4. **Application administrators** - these are users of the applications that administer the applications usinf their backend with special privileges within it
5. **Application users** - these are users who use the deployed applications wihout any special privileges
