# Description: In terms of future proofing, I put an option here to select the deployment OS.
# It is not currently structured for the first release to support anything other than ubuntu + debian,
# which is the defacto standard for cloud hosting anyway, but, in the future, it might be
# feasible to give the user a choice about which OS they wish to deploy to
