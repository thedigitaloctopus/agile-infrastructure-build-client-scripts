# Description: When you deploy an application you have built using this toolkit, you may want to perform some of your own
# customisations specific to that application. If you do you will need to make your customisations in the
# ${HOME}/applicationscripts directory on the webserver and ${HOME}/applicationscripts directory on the database
# server. If you want to make customisations which only apply to a specific application type, then, following
# the example scripts should make it clear enough how to do that. The only other thing you need to do is to add
# your application to this file as you can see the "BASIC SOCIAL NETWORK" has been added as an example.
# At build time, then all you need to do is select the application type you are installing and it will perform the
# customisations you have defined on the webserver and database server.
#
# So, say you had created an application, "Basic Blogging Platform" in your favourite CMS, then, you would define
# your customisations on the webserver and database and then, add an option below, Basic Blogging Platform,
# following the example which has already been given. If you don't want any customisations specific
# to your application, then you don't need to add it here, but, it is probably best practice that you do so that for
# anyone modifying or extending you application the strcture is in place. If you are a developer, then in time, you
# will probably have several applications installed. Maybe, "Fred's Friends Community", "Jane's
# blogging platform" or "Jan's ecommerce platfom" and so on. The limit on what you can create as an application depends
# only on the limitis of the CMS.

# When you build and customise an application, you can give it a type, so that you can bespoke customise it.
# This is where you select the type of the application you are deploying. If it is a virgin application, then
# it's type will always be 0. A virgin application is, for example, an unmodified CMS instance as is from the developers.
