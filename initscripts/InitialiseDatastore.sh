# Description : This script will enable the user to choose what "datastore" provider they
# wish to choose. A datastore is a highly available webservice where arbitrary files and
# numbers of files can be stored. In ordinary usage, this datastore will be used to store
# images and media.
# This script also allows the user to elect to have "supersafe" backups made. What this means
# is that when a backup of the webroot or the database is run it stores a secondary backup
# to the user's elected datastore. This is super safe, because if anything happens to the
# ordinary backup, in the repository then you also have another one in the datastore to rely on. You
# know the old saying, backup, backup and backup again and so it is recommended to have "supersafe"
# backups switched on.
