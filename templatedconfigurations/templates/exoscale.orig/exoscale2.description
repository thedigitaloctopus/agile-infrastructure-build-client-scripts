VIRGIN DEVELOPMENT MODE INSTALLATION OF JOOMLA 
----------------------------------------------

DETAIL: This template, as is, will deploy to "Geneva" on "Exoscale". It will deploy a "Joomla" instance in "development mode" . You will need a cloudflare account with your "email address" and "global API key" and you will also need an "Exoscale account" with API keys for an IAM user with sufficient access rights to manipulate the object store and the cloud server machines. The first 25 export statements of the template all require review and configuration and some of these are marked mandatory meaning they have to be set. You need to give the requisite API keys here so that the build can complete.
The database used by default is "MySQL" on a VPS and the "Webserver" is "Apache".
