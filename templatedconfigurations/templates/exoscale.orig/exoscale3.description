VIRGIN DEVELOPMENT MODE INSTALLATION OF WORDPRESS 
----------------------------------------------

DETAIL: This template, as is, will deploy to "Geneva" on "Exoscale". It will deploy a "Wordpress" instance in "development mode". You will need a "Cloudflare" account with your "email address" and "global API key" and you will also need an "Exoscale" account with "API keys for an IAM user" with sufficient access rights to manipulate the object store and the cloud server machines. The first 25 export statements of the template require review and configuration and some of these are marked mandatory. You need to give the requisite API keys here so that the build can complete. 
The database used by default is "MySQL" on a VPS and the webserver is "Apache".
