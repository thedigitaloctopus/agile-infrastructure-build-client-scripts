BUILD FROM PREVIOUSLY GENERATED SNAPSHOT IMAGES
-----------------------------------------------

In exoscale8.tmpl, we performed a build which generates snapshots. To use those snapshots, set AUTOSCALE_FROM_SNAPSHOTS="1" and fill in SNAPSHOT_ID and the AUTOSCALER, WEBSERVER and DATABASE image ids. Other than that the template is the same as digitalocean1.tmpl and it will build your servers from snapshots previously generated by exoscale8.tmpl
